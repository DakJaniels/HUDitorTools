## Features

### HUD Editor

- Customizable grid (color, alpha, size)
- Snap elements to the grid
- Right-click context menu on HUD elements:
  - Hide / show elements **in the HUD editor** (not on the live HUD) so you can find and move things more easily
  - Reset position
- Border / fill color for HUD-hidden elements (default red). This is the element's own Visible checkbox on the live HUD, not the editor hide above.
- Live color picker for grid, selected, unselected, and hidden element colors. Changes apply immediately. The picker is movable and remembers its position. Reset restores the active slot.

### Info Box (selected element)

- Search the elements dropdown by display name / control name (collapsible search header)
- Right-click context menu to hide / show elements in the HUD editor
- User-hidden entries are marked with `-` around the name and colored with the hidden-element color
- Settings button (gear, top left) when enabled in LAM:
  - Always show element names (not only on mouse over or selection)
  - Hide names with a width `<= n` (slider)
  - Show Grid
  - Grid Snap
  - Grid size
  - Show color picker
  - Colors submenu (Grid / Selected / Unselected / Hidden)
- If the settings button is disabled, grid options and the color-picker toggle stay on the Info Box options section

Configure settings in the LibAddonMenu panel (`/hudis`). Some options only appear on the Info Box when the settings context menu is enabled in LAM.
